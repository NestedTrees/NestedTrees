### Nested Trees

This is a repository containing the source code and dataset access information for the paper "Nested Trees for Longitudinal Classification".

### Codebase

The codebase is presented as an Eclipse project written entirely in Java.

### Running experiments

The experiments are run using the `main` method of the `Experimenter` class. Full list of parameter fields and their descriptions can also be found in that method.

### Accessing the ELSA dataset

Due to the current ELSA license restrictions, we can not make the dataset used in this study publicly available here. We will, however, hapily share our pre-processed dataset with all holders of the UKDS End User Licence (you will need to also accept the Additional condition for SN 5050). Please follow the procedure described here: https://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/accessing-elsa-data . You will need to read the description of the "Main ELSA Dataset" section, follow the "UK Data Service" link and register for access to the item `SN 5050`. Once you have gained access to this item, please send us an email and we will then be able to provide the pre-processed dataset used in this study to you. The email address for requests is: nesteddecisiontree@gmail.com
